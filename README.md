# Game of Life

This is my custom version of **John Conway's Game of Life**, developed in **JavaScript** as part of an assignment for the course **Fundamentals of Technology** during my second year of university. 

### About the Project

The objective of this project was to create a game using only **JavaScript** with minimal **HTML**. This experience allowed me to deepen my understanding of JavaScript and explore the basics of game mechanics through Conway's famous cellular automaton.

### Features
- Implemented entirely in JavaScript.
- Minimal use of HTML.
- Simulation of Conway's "Game of Life" with custom logic and rules.

### Technologies
- **JavaScript**
- **HTML** (minimal usage)
